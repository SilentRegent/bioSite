         <p>I began playing soccer when I was four years old until college. My two year old loves spending time outdoors and before we knew it we were playing 
          sports for fun. When I met my husband, I mentioned how eager I was to be able to visit different locations on my bucket list around the world. 
          I believe I got interested in traveling because I’ve always had an appreciation for culture and diversity. Since my husband and I have been married 
          for three years, we have made it a tradition to take a week long trip at the minimum every year.

        <h2>Potential Future Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
          I don’t foresee any of my hobbies becoming a side business or career at this time. I had an opportunity to do a traveling job as an occupational therapist 
          but around that time I found out that we were expecting and decided that I wanted to stay close to our families so that our son could grow up with his cousins 
          nearby and have consistency.

        <p>
          In the near future, I would like to pick up running. Running has always been something that I feel would be beneficial to 
          incorporate into my life as it can give me opportunities to be outside more often and build my cardiovascular endurance
